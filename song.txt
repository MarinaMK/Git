Euphoria
Loreen

Why, why can't this moment last forevermore?
Tonight, tonight eternity's an open door
No, don't ever stop doing the things you do
Don't go, in every breath I take I'm breathing you
Euphoria
Forever, 'till the end of time
From now on, only you and I
We're going up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Euphoria An everlasting piece of art
A beating love within my heart
